# Prerequisities

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - install the latest LTS node version (for example, node 10.16.3 - see the installation instructions on the site)   
NOTE: It is recommended to install and use nvm (see https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and install node 10.16.3 by issuing `nvm install v10.16.3`
